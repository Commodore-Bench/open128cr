# Open128CR

This is a clone of the Commodore 128 CR home computer made with KiCad, licensed under [CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).

It contains both schematic and PCB layout, traced from an original 128 CR board.
PCB layout is not finished and will not work mechnically if manufactured, as such it has also not been tested electronically.

Some of the components have been copied from the [bit-preserve project](https://github.com/baldengineer/bit-preserve) and modified.
